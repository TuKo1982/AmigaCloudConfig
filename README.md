I made this simple MUI 3.8 GUI to ease configuration of Norbert Kett's Amiga Cloud Handlers. This app is targetting AmigaOS 3.x and can be compiled with ADE with MUI 3.8dev includes.

AmigaCloudHandlers binaries :
https://aminet.net/package/comm/tcp/AmigaCloudHandlers

AmigaCloudHandlers sources :
https://github.com/anchor76/amiga_cloud_handlers

As of today, Amiga Cloud Handlers in their current version are not working anymore so probably is high that my GUI is also not working as expected as I couldn't test every feature. If anyone is interested into continuing Norbert's work, I will try to make sure the GUI works as intended.
